### All in One Launcher‎  https://bfmeladder.com/download
The All in One Launcher is the ultimate launcher for all 3 BFME games. It makes installing, modding and playing the game a breeze. Play with people around the world with built in multiplayer support trough Arena, discover new patches, maps and mods trough the Workshop, watch BFME quides and much more, this is the one launcher to rule them all!

### Online Arena  https://bfmeladder.com/download
Online Arena aims to be the leading platform for online BFME gaming. After more than 3 years of research and development, we brought back Quickmatch, and made online BFME gaming as easy as clicking a button. Arena features completely automatic matchmaking, win detection, and ladders. You just click and play! The total number of players who have already signed up is more than 50,000!

### Workshop Studio  https://bfmeladder.com/download
The Bfme Workshop aims to be the new home of BFME modding. With a brand new, completely open ecosystem of tools and platforms, BFME modding has never been this easy! Anyone can upload to the workshop by using a tool like Workshop Studio, or the public API.

### WorkshopKit‎  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BfmeFoundationProject.WorkshopKit"><img src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/BfmeFoundationProject.WorkshopKit"/></a>
WorkshopKit allows you to easily integrate the Bfme Workshop into your own projects, and makes it easy to access the public Workshop APIs in a managed code environment. If you are developing a tool for bfme, like a launcher, this package also has utilities for patch switching and installing/activating packages!

***Ps: This is the same library the launcher and arena uses, so it's top tier!***

### OnlineKit‎  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BfmeFoundationProject.OnlineKit"><img src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/BfmeFoundationProject.OnlineKit"/></a>
OnlineKit allows you to easily and seemlessly integrate Online Arena into your own projects. If you want to get an access key for your application (because this does require one), reach out to us at bfme109team@gmail.com

***Ps: This is the same library the launcher uses to integrate arena, so it's also top tier!***

### BfmeKit‎  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BfmeFoundationProject.BfmeKit"><img src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/BfmeFoundationProject.BfmeKit"/></a>
BfmeKit helps you install BFME and read/modify the registry keys used by the BFME games in a managed code environment. 

***Ps: This is the same library the launcher and arena uses, so it's top tier!***

## Source Code
Besides Arena, everything we make is open source, and is included inside this monorepo. There are no external dependencies required (except of course Visual Studio, and the relevant .NET SDKs), and everything should just build and work. If it doesn't, make an issue in the issues tab, and we'll see what we can do.

## License
We don't have a license. Everything that is in this repository is open source. Don't abuse it, don't get sued because of it, don't die because of it, but if you do, don't drag us into it, because we are not taking any responsibility for what you do with it :)

## Contributing
Feel free to! We can always use an extra pair of hands and eyes to fix and catch bugs! The rules to contributing are simple: be respectful, use common sense, and don't do stupid shit. Anything else is ok.
